Sweet Dreams Online: PHP and SQL Roleplay forum

Contact aaron@acwpd.com for more information

This was originally built on a PHP 5.3 system, running MySQL 5.3.12.

I have used and am using this project to teach myself PHP and a practical application of SQL.

This repo is intended as the "framework" for the actual game. All of the Proprietary stuff (Powers, Natures, Cliques)
will be kept in the database itself.
